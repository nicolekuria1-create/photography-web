				“Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever.
				It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything.”

					<p class="photo-note">
						Some hearts grow tired of carrying the weight of the world, and begin to chase silence in anything that can numb the noise.
						For someone living with addiction, escape can feel like borrowed freedom but real peace begins where healing, truth, and support are allowed in.

						Some people fight quiet battles with their mental health, yet still show up with a smile and perform strength for everyone around them.
						This image is for the ones healing in private while carrying others in public your pain is real, your effort is seen,you are loved just as much as you love others and your softness is not weakness .

					<p class="photo-note">
						This comes from one of my favourite movie called 'Waves'(2019), which depicts how people go and chase the rush of love without even finding it in themselves first.
						The two characters, in my opinion, are both worn out with the chase, but because it is the only thing that makes them feel alive, they keep going for more, which leaves both at the end miserable, dead and alive.

					<p class="photo-note">
						I think the world of today has reduced the purpose of life to capitalism and that leaves people forgetting what life is even about anymore. You yes you were never meant to stick to one path of life that you chose during your teenage years till you grow old.
						There is a whole world you are yet to see, people you are yet to meet and many more. It's all about taking one step at a time and enjoying what life has to offer. SONDER is what describes this all perfectly.
